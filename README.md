# UGE-Unbiased-Graph-Embedding

This is the code for paper "Unbiased Graph Embedding with Biased Graph Observations" accepted by WWW'22.

## Requirements

Code is tested in Python 3.8 and PyTorch 1.8~1.11. Some major requirements are listed below:

```
torch
dgl
pandas
numpy
scipy
tqdm
pickle
sklearn
```

## Datasets

We evaluate our method on three datasets: **Pokec-z**, **Pokec-n** and **Movielens-1M**. Raw data are uploaded or will be automatically downloaded to <code>./raw_data</code> folder. We have constructed graphs from the raw data and stored them in <code>./processed_data</code> folder in unified csv format for the model to load directly.

1. **Pokec-z** and **Pokec-n** are sampled from [soc_Pokec](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Pokec.html) following [FairGNN](https://github.com/EnyanDai/FairGNN). Raw and processed data have been already uploaded to <code>./raw_data</code> and <code>./processed_data</code> folders. 
2. **Movielens-1M**'s [raw data](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) is too large to hold on github, and it can be automatically downloaded to <code>./raw_data</code> folder and be processed to <code>./processed_data</code> folder when launching UGE training process. 

<p>To include and customize your own data, please refer to <code>create_dataset.py</code>.</p>
